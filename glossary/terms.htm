<h2>Anime Terms to Know</h2>
    <p>There are many terms the anime community uses to describe shows, characters, and pretty much everything else. Sometimes the words are in Japanese and other times they are in English; either way the terms used are certainly hard for newcomers to understand and remain confusing even for some of the most diehard fans. The list below is by no means comprehensive, but hopefully it gives you a good starting point towards better understanding this terribly mismatched vocabulary anime lovers have created.</p>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWulJiQnbLY"><img src="images/baka.jpg" width="230px" height="180px" img style="border:2px solid black;float: right" alt="angry anime girl" title="Asuka is angry at Baka Shinji."></a>
<h3>Terms that describe Characters</h3>
    <p><b><i>Baka</i></b> - expression that someone is stupid or an idiot. "Baka!" Term is excessively used by the character Asuka in <i>Neon Genesis Evangelion</i></p> 
    <p><b><i>Bishounen</i></b> - used to describe "pretty boys" that have feminine features. Example: Victor from <i>Yuri!!! on Ice</i></p>
    <p><b><i>Chibi</i></b> - something small and cute. Example: Reborn from <i>Katekyo Hitman Reborn!</i></p>
    <p><b><i>Chuunibyou</i></b> - "8th grade syndrome," people older than middle school age that believe they have special powers but obviously don't. Example: Rikka from <i>Love, Chunibyo and Other Delusions!</i></p>
        <img src="images/urara.png" width="270px" height="160px" style=" border:2px solid black; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px" alt="example of dandere archetype" title="Shiraishi is so shy!">
    <p><b><i>Dandere</i></b> - character archetype that is quiet, shy, and unthreatening. They often wear glasses and love to read and usually only open up around their close friends or love interest. Example: Shiraishi from <i>Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches</i></p>
    <p><b><i>Deredere</i></b> - overly cheerful and hyper character type. Constantly seen smothering the people they like with affection. They could get punched in the face and still instantly revert to their cheerful personality. Example: Usagi from <i>Sailor Moon</i></p>
    <p><b><i>Gaki</i></b> - used to describe someone who is immature or a punk/ brat. Example: Joe from <i>Tomorrow's Joe</i></p>
    <p><b>Honorifics</b> - we don't do this in English, but in Japanese people use honorifics/ suffixes to address people depending on familiarity, age differece, and respect</p>
        <ul><li><i>-chan</i> : typically used for children but is also used by people who have known each other since childhood as a term of endearment. Mostly used when addressing females.</li>

            <li><i>-san</i> : used to address someone of equal or of close social standing, usually for someone you are less familiar with. In English we would use Mr., Miss, Mrs., etc.</li>

            <li><i>-senpai</i> : used to address someone who is your senior in school. Upperclassman. Can be from the same social class as you but are superior due to their grade level.</li>

            <li><i>-sensei</i> : used to address a teacher</li>
        </ul>

    <p><b><i>Kuudere</i></b> - character archetype that is emotionless and distant. They can come off as very blunt and cynical on the outside, but are really just marshmallows on the inside and care a lot about their close friends and love interest.
