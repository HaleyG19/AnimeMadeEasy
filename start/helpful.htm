<h2>Helpful Links and Resources</h2>
    <p>Alright, so by now you may have decided you are indeed interested in anime, but what now? Where can you watch it? Where can you learn more? How can you connect with the community? Well don't worry, I'll give you a few resources that will help answer any more questions you may have. There are a lot of awesome websites out there whose sole purpose is to help you get started and stay updated with the latest anime news straight from Japan. This isn't an extensive list but the websites here are definitely the best places to find more information and help you kickstart your journey into the world of anime. </p>
<h3>For Streaming</h3>
    <p>Okay so you've realized you want to watch some of the shows talked about on this website and want to know where you can do so. There's only one problem: you don't live in Japan. Don't worry just yet, there are plenty of places for you to watch anime in the West, both legal...and not so legal (but I'll refrain from mentioning those here).</p>
<p><b><a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/">Crunchyroll</a></b></p>
    <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/"><img src="images/helpful/crunchyroll.jpg" width="200px" height="120px" style="margin-left: 10px; border:2px solid black; float: right" alt="crunchyroll logo" title="Crunchroll"></a>
    <p>To start, there is Crunchyroll. This is one of the top websites for streaming anime legally outside of Japan. Updated with anime from the latest seasons weekly and with a stock of hundreds more from years past, Crunchyroll will most likely have all the anime you are looking for. On this site you can watch anime for free or pay for a premium subscription which is $7.99 a month. The free pass allows you to watch most anime on the site in standard quality with ads, while the premium pass eliminates the ads, increases viewing quality and lets you watch anime on all your devices. Overall, Crunchyroll is a great place to start if you want to quickly see if anime is something you're interested in.</p>
    <a href="https://www.funimation.com/"><img src="images/helpful/funimation.png" width="170" height="150px" style="margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; border:2px solid black; float: left" alt="funimation logo" title="Funimation"></a>
<p><a href="https://www.funimation.com/"></a><b><a href="https://www.funimation.com/">Funimation</a></b></p>
    <p>Funimation is another streaming service website that has a massive collection of anime for you to watch. Funimation is also responsible for dubbing a large majority of the anime that comes out of Japan so you can never go wrong with their dubs (I prefer to watch anime subtitled though). On this website you can watch any subbed version of an anime for free but you must subsrcibe to the premium version if you want to watch dubbed content. Again this is a good site to start out with streaming anime.</p>
<p><b><a href="https://www.netflix.com/ca/">Netflix</a></b><a href="https://www.netflix.com/ca/"><img src="images/helpful/net.jpg" width="160" height="160px" style="margin-left: 10px; border:2px solid black; float: right" alt="netflix logo" title="Netflix"></a></p>
    <p>While Netflix is known for its vast collection of television shows and movies, the platform also has quite an extensive collection of anime as well, including Netflix originals and ones made in Japan. Most people already have a Netflix account for other reasons so this platform is super accessible for anyone just looking to take a peek at what anime is like.</p>
<p><b><a href= "https://www.hulu.com/welcome">Hulu</a></b></p>
    <p>Like Netflix, Hulu is a streaming service that has hundreds of TV shows and movies. However, they also have a lot of anime thanks to a recent partnership with Funimation. Unlike Funimation and Crunchyroll though, Hulu does not have an extensive collection of anime yet. Still it is worth mentioning because it does'nt just have anime on it and can be used for other TV watching purposes too.</p>
<h3>For Anime News</h3> 
    <p>If you are looking for the latest news from Japan regarding anime and manga then the these next websites are exactly what you need.</p>
<a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/"><img src="images/helpful/animenewsnet.jpg" width="200" height="180px" style="margin-right: 10px; border:2px solid black; float: left" alt="anime news network logo" title="Anime News Network"></a><p><b><a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/">Anime News Network</a></b></p>
    <p>One of the oldest anime websites around, the Anime News Network publishes dozens of articles and reviews every month about what is going on in the world of anime both in Japan and internationally. If you are looking for the latest news then this should be your first stop.</p>
    <a href="https://manga.tokyo/"><img src="images/helpful/manga.png" width="230" height="120px" style="margin-left: 10px; border:2px solid black; float: right" alt="manga.tokyo logo" title="Manga.Tokyo"></a>
<p><b><a href="https://manga.tokyo/">Manga.Tokyo</a></b></p>
    <p>Manga.Tokyo is dedicated to providing anime fans around the world with anime reviews, guids, news, and reports directly from Japan. It is also one of the few anime news sources from Japan that also have an English language website.</p>
<h3>For Staying Organized</h3>
    <p>If you start to really get into anime then you may need a place to keep track of what you've watched. These next sites are perfect for keeping you organized and on top of things and also serve as great resources for seeing what anime are out there, what's currently airing, how they have been ranked by other fans, and much more. </p>
<a href="https://myanimelist.net/"><img src="images/helpful/mal.png" width="150" height="150px" style="margin-right: 10px; border:2px solid black; float: left" alt="Myanimelist  logo" title="MyAnimeList"></a><p><b><a href="https://myanimelist.net/">MyAnimeList</a></b></p>
    <p>I personally use this website almost everyday to keep track of the anime I've watched, check out what's going on in the community, and search for more anime to watch. MyAnimeList is your one stop spot to answer all your questions. Have you ever wondered if people think <i>Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</i> is better than the original <i>Fullmetal Alchemist</i>? Well, MAL's got you covered (the answer is obviously FMA:B btw). From reviews, to lists, to rankings, to reccomendations, it doesn't really get better than this if you are a fan of anime and are looking for a site to stay updated.</p>
      <a href="https://kitsu.io/explore/anime"><img src="images/helpful/kitsu.png" width="200" height="110px" style="margin-left: 10px; border:2px solid black; float: right" alt="kitsu logo" title="Kitsu"></a>
<p><b><a href="https://kitsu.io/explore/anime">Kitsu</a></b></p>
    <p>Like MAL, Kitsu is a site that allows you to keep track of the anime you are watching and find new ones you may also enjoy. Although not as extensive as MAL, Kitsu allows you to browse for anime by genre, popularity, release date and much more.</p>
