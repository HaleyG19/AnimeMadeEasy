<h2>Mainstream Misconceptions</h2>
    <img src="images/cbopannoyed.gif" width="330px" height="220px" img style=" margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 5px; border:2px solid black;float: right" alt="eyebrow twitch" title="How I feel when people trash anime for bad reasons">
    <p>For reasons beyond my understanding, anime generally recieves a negative representation from those that know nothing or very little about it. Those that know very little about anime view fans as socially awkward, overgrown children obsessed with cartoons that they should be too old to still enjoy. Of course, with every misconception there is a sliver of truth and perhaps the image that comes to mind for many when they think of anime fans is the stereotypical <i>otaku</i> fanboy that never leaves the house and has a collection of big-titted, scantily-clad, anime figurines. And yeah, those people definitely exist, but they do not represent the whole community and it's about time people start recognizing that anime is much more than this poorly concieved stereotype.</p>
    <p>Hopefully, this section can help eliminate some of the misconceptions you may have about anime, and help you better understand the medium itself and the people that watch it.</p>
<h3>Misconception: Anime Isn't Smart or Original</h3>
    <p>Um...okay? Have you even seen any anime? I could go on for ages listing anime that are both intelligent and entirely original. Sometimes it's even the case that anime with smart and original ideas get adapted elsewhere in a different medium and the orginal concept gets miscredited. For instance, <i>Ghost in the Shell</i>, an anime film from 1995 was a major influence of <i>The Matrix</i> series which didnt release its first film until 1999. So, while you may think anime is copying something you've already seen before, it may actually be the other way around.</p>
    <p>Of course there are also shitty anime out there that simply try to replicate things that have already been done. But that's true of every television format and anime as a whole certainly doesn't deserve to be criticized because of a hasty generalization made by people that don't always have their facts straight. </p>

<h3>Misconception: All anime fans are Otaku or Weebs (In other words, we're all freaks)</h3>
    <p>Okay, I won't deny that the anime community does consist of a great deal of <i>otaku</i> and quite a few weebs, and yes these people can sometimes be really strange. However, these groups do not define the entirety of anime's fanbase and should not be outsider's only conception of the community. Most of us are just regular people that just so happen to enjoy Japanese animation, and that's all.</p>
<h3>Misconception: Anime is for Kids</h3>
    <p>Although some anime aimed at younger audiences, such as <i>Pokemon</i> and <i>Ponyo</i>, many others are nothing like your average Saturday morning cartoons.</p>
    <p>On the contrary, anime can be violent, bloody, and crude; there are characters that weild guns, swords, and pilot man killing mecha. Anime can explore adult themes and can contain sexual content and other things that are certainly not appropriate for children.</p>
    <p>In reality, the only thing anime has in common with cartoons is that they are both animated, outside of that there are very few similarities. You can be sure of one thing; there's absolutely no way I'd ever let a kid watch anime such as <i>Black Lagoon</i>, <i>Hellsing Ultimate</i>, or <i>Psycho-Pass</i>.</p>

                <a><img src="images/pass.gif" width="360px" height="220px" img style=" border:2px solid black;" title="Psycho-Pass" alt="shooting gun"></a>
            </center>
            <p></p>
<h3>Misconception: Anime is Porn</h3>  
    <p>Seriously? This is just wrong. No, not all anime is porn. There are <i>some</i> anime that are a bit overtly sexual, mainly from the <i>ecchi</i> genre. Similarly, there are forms of Japanese pornography that use the same art style and animation techniques as anime, these are called <i>hentai</i> and are distinctly separate from the rest of anime.</p>
    <p>Not all fans of anime enjoy hentai, just like not all fans of <i>Harry Potter</i> would enjoy seeing Dumbledore naked. </p>
    <p>The line may be fine for some anime, but overall, the majority of anime <b>is not pornographic</b> in any way, shape, or form.</p>
<h3>Misconception: Anime Isn't As Good As Regular TV</h3> 
    <p>Okay so this just isn't true. We've been over this; <b>yes</b> there are some shitty anime out there, <b>yes</b> regular television is probably much better than some of these, but <b>no</b> you don't <i>have</i> to watch them just like you dont <i>have</i> to watch regular shitty TV shows.</p>
    <p>In the end, what you choose to watch is what you choose to watch and you are the judge of what you believe to be good or not. However, just because you think something is bad doesn't mean that it is and just because you love something doesn't mean it's the greatest thing in the universe. You don't have to love anime and you don't have to love regular TV; do what you want, just don't call a whole medium shit because it's not what you personally enjoy. </p>

<p>Now that you know a little bit more about anime, please don't let any of these mainstream misconceptions deter you from delving further into the world of anime. I promise, most of us don't bite, and the ones that do probably don't venture outside their parent's basement much.</p>
