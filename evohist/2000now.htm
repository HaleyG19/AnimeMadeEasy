<h2>The End of Anime? (2000 - present)</h2>
    <p>In order to cope with the ever-expanding market, and an industry that had begun generating hundreds of new series each year, broadcasting networks began airing anime in seasons. Much like other television networks, anime is now broadcast in fall, winter, spring, and summer sesaons each lasting around 4 months.</p>
    <p>Despite its general popularity, the anime industry has endured many hardships since the beginning of the new millenium. For instance, with the rise of the Internet and online torrenting sites, shows began to fall victim to piracy, resulting in massive losses for production studios. However, in recent years many studios have found a way around this and now work with streaming sites inside and outside of Japan to make anime more accessible and readily available for fans worldwide. So, while profits may not be as high as they were in the "golden age," the anime industry continues to fight on and continues to grow with each coming year.</p>
    <p>To say the anime market has flourished would be an understatement; there are more anime fans now than ever before and the numbers just keep going up. However, some would argue that over the past two decades the anime industry has begun to die, and the <i>otaku</i> subculture that parasytically thrives on it is a major contributor to this downward spiral. With the popularity of anime that look good but lack substance, made by studios like Kyoto Animation, many believe the true meaning of Japanese animation has been lost.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, it is impossible to ignore that some of the best anime ever made have been created during this period. Shows like <i>Samurai Champloo</i> (2004), <i>Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</i> (2009), <i>Steins;Gate</i> (2011), and <i>Made in Abyss</i> (2017) have received widespread adoration worldwide and stand as proof that anime can have both good art, interesting plots and quality characters. More people are watching anime every season and with the help of streaming platforms like Netflix, Funimation and Crunchyroll, this popularity continues to grow even outside of Japan.

    <p>Likewise, anime filmmaking has become better than ever thanks to innovations in animation technology and equipment. Several major hits since the year 2000 include <i>Spirited Away</i> (2001), <i>Howl's Moving Castle</i> (2004), <i>Wolf Children</i> (2012), and <i>Your Name.</i> (2016). What lies in store next for the anime industry is something we'll have to wait and see, but one thing is for sure; anime is far from dead.</p>

    <p>Ultimately, with the sheer amount of anime that has been produced since the year 2000 it is hardly possible to discuss all the big hits and changes to the industry in such a short overview. However, if you're interested in learning more, historian Jonathan Clements wrote a book entitled <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Anime-History-Jonathan-Clements/dp/1844573907"><i>Anime: A History</i></a> which comprehensively recounts the history of Japanese animation from its beginning in the early 1900s to the present day. It's a wonderful book, and helped a lot with the writing of this section of Anime Made Easy, so check it out if you're interested.</p>
