<h2><b>In the Beginning (1907 - 1922)</b></h2>
    <p>Coinciding with the birth of Japan's film industry, Japanese animation (anime) did not begin production until approximately 1907.</p> 
    <p>Many early creations used rudimentary techniques to make the two-dimensional images on screen move. Such techniques included using chalkboards and paper without pre-printed backgrounds to simulate movement. The more advanced, yet expensive, technique of cel animation was also used at this time, although not often.</p>
    <p>There is a great deal of debate surrounding the date of the first anime created and it remains unclear to this day which film is deserving of this title. For many years it was not definitively known if any anime was made before 1917, however, recent discoveries unearthed the Japanese animated short film <i>Activity Photo</i> (<i>Katsudo Shashin</i>) which is believed to have been produced as early as 1907. The 3-second short film depicts a boy in a sailor uniform, that writes "activity photo" in Japanese on a board, removes his hat, and bows.</p>

    <p>Prior to the discovery of <i>Katsudo Shashin</i>, the short animated film entitled <i>The Dull Sword</i> (<i>Namakura Gatana</i>) made in 1917 was believed to be the oldest surviving Japanese anime. This film, 4 minutes in length, tells the story of a foolish samurai's mistaken purchase of a dull sword.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, not many anime from this early period survived or had their creation recorded. This is largely because of the widespread destruction caused by the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 and bombings during the the Second World War. As well, it was common at the time for Japanese animation reels to be taken apart after they were played in theaters, and those that esacped this fate often fell victim instead to disintegration over time.</p>
    <p>A few prominent figures of Japanese animation began making anime at this time, most notably the three "fathers of anime." This group consisted of Oten Shimokawa, Jun'ichi Kouchi, and Seitaro Kitayama, each of which made numerous contributions to the field of Japanese animation during this period and beyond. Kouchi and Kitayama formed the first two anime studios in 1921, although neither studio survived after the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 made it too difficult to profit from making anime.</p>
