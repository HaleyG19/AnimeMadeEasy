  <h2>Bounty Hunters and Late Night Television (1990 - 1999)</h2>
    <p>After such a fantastic decade in the 1980s, the 1990s anime industry had a lot to live up to. Generally, considered a low point for anime as profits decreased as a result of Japan's economic crash in 1991, the 90s were still a great time for anime.</p>  
    <p>At first, things were difficult. Anime studios and creators tried hard to maintain the success of the 1980s and strove to recapture that which made it great. This task proved harder than one would think and the industry quickly realized a serious change of pace was in order.</p>
    <p>The first major step in a new direction was taken by Hideaki Anno in 1995 with the creation of <i>Neon Genesis Evangelion</i>. Set in a distant future <i>Neon Genesis Evangelion</i> is a mecha anime that tells the story of protagonist Shinji Ikari, a boy chosen to pilot Evangelion unit 01 (a kickass giant fucking robot) and save Tokyo from "angels." Basically, the show focuses on Shinji's struggles to <b>just get in the fucking robot</b> (sorry for the anime joke here, people who have see the show may laugh though).<img src="images/evablood.gif" style=" border:2px solid black; float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-top: 10px;" height="210px" width="300px" alt="evangelion unit raining blood" title="SO MUCH BLOOD"> The show serves as a complicating interpretation of Judeo-Christian religions and is said to criticize the anime subculture from which it derives. Likewise, the anime was highly controversial because of the amount of blood, violence and sexual content portrayed throughout the series and resulted in TV Tokyo increasing the censorship of anime content which definitely restricted what anime could do in the years to come. Still, <i>Evangelion</i> was a huge success and inspired not only the rest of the decade, but also generations yet to come. </p>
    <p>After <i>Evangelion</i> anime shows became more experimental and organic. International audiences began to grow and the <i>otaku</i> subculture thrived. That's when things started to get a little weird late at night. Anime creators began to use late night television as a stage for their experimental exploits resulting in anime like <i>Serial Experiments Lain</i> in 1998. These anime explored themes of philosphy, alienation and loneliness, and were overall quite eerie to watch but still massively popular in Japan and abroad.</p>
    <p>In 1998, one of sci-fi's coolest and jazziest anime was made. Shinichiro Watanabe's <i>Cowboy Bebop</i> follows the adventures of the space bounty hunter crew consisting of Spike Spiegel, Jet, Faye Valentine, Edward, and their dog Ein. Yoko Kanno, the shows music director, created an awesome blues and jazz inspired soundtrack which largely increased the popularity of the show and is still beloved by fans today. A massive success in Japan, the show may be even more popular internationally and remains one of the top rated anime of all time.</p>

    <p>Obviously this article is glossing over a lot of the best anime from the decade, but there is hardly enough space in the world to include everything. So, to conclude the discussion of this period let's briefly mention one of the most expensive and critically acclaimed anime films of all time. Miyazaki's <i>Princess Mononoke</i> cost a whopping $20 million to produce and quickly became known as the best film the anime industry had ever produced. Anything that came after, had this giant to look up to.</p>
